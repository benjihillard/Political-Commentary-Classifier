How many in the Trump administration has already gone to jail for working with Russian operatives again. A lot. More than any administration in US history.,1
"When you join the Trump team of traitors,you will be watched.Real Americans,not Trumpsters,take Americans mixing with Russian spy's seriously.",1
"So because they didn't charge him with anything, he wants to sue? If every person investigated was to sue the police or government, there wouldn't be time to convict criminals.",1
There were dozens of Trump administration associates spied on and had their lives in turmoil. This Page fellow should consider himself lucky he didn't go to jail.,1
"If Page wins,then I'm suing my city.I was followed last year for several blocks by a police officer.I wasn't stopped or charged for anything,but they were watching me.I know they were./s",1
"I'm not sure who is the weirdest--- this guy, Stone, Flynn or Rudy",1
"I have no idea if this lawsuit will go anywhere, I'm not a lawyer and know far too little about the legalities of what the FBI did to make a judgement on that, but I do know one thing that has been proven far beyond reasonable doubt at least with me personally: Carter Page's reputation was absolute CRAP long before he started spouting off about his great Russia connections that led to the investigation of him and others. That part of the suit is definitely not valid. IMO, he is a dirtball, for lack of a legal definition of him.",1
"You can't fight the Anti Trump witch hunt. Whether it's election fraud, impeachment, or Russian hoax, the deck is stacked against you",1
"He's filing this now in hopes that Barr will immediately settle out of court (which will most likely happen)... once Biden controls the DoJ, this has no chance.",1
This does smack of a Netanyahu-Trump plot. I cannot understand why some people think we are so much better off now with no nuclear agreement that Trump's owen people said was working.,1
Assassination is not the solution to international disagreements. Those that ordered the assassination should be held accountable. If a US senior scientist was assassinated here on US soil Americans would be outraged as should all Iranians be now.,1
"I would guess that Iran has more than 1 nuclear scientist. These targeted assassinations serve very little purpose. The next in line just steps up and takes over. I understand the problem with Iran and the future of the Middle East. The future in the Middle East is a repeat of the last 1400 years. Two Muslim sects at each others throats with Israel thrown in for good measure. A conflict for us to stay out of. I agree with Iran, the Israelis are probably responsible.",1
Sounds like a good operation,1
"Targeted assassinations against nation states are a slippery slope. This is now twice in 12 months. If they retaliate in the same way the US government would freak out. Call it terrorism, demand international action, etc",1
Iranians are the killers. They are cowards that hide behind the Revolutionary Guards.,1
How many F-35 F-15 and F-16 are ready to bomb Iran for any retaliatory Act?,1
Iran has been murdering Jews around the world for decades and now the man who is helping them build a weapon to murder more Jews was killed and they are angry?,1
trump is trying to start as many fires as he can and leave them for Biden to deal with.,1
"Iran is stuck in the 7th Century, Intolerance and misogyny is the order-of-the day there. I have been to Tehran, several times on business, and certainly wouldn't want to go on vacation there, can't even have a beer, or admire the female form, and there are some beautiful women who are made to cover up by men who wander round holding hands with each other. It's an open-secret that their ""peaceful"" nuclear program is to develop weapons to wipe Israel off the map; good work, Mossad! We cannot let the anti-Semites win.",1
"If Israel wants a war with Iran fine, but they cannot have my sons to fight it for them. These countries are both so steeped in their tribalism they can't even see the whole world has passed them by.",1
"Assasination like this a la Putin and then boasting about it as Trump did certainly sets up the stage for retaliation,...it's why most countries try to avoid it and certainly don't tweet their approval if it happens,",1
"The Pentagon is deploying a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier to the Persian Gulf, CNN national security correspondent Barbara Starr reported Friday.",1
These are the same people who put a hit out on Salman Rushdie for writing a book. They have no basis from which to complain.,1
"So is a.potential mideast cluster f.. of a war going to be Donnie's departing gift. America first , Awesome! /s",1
Interesting how Iran is the leader in global proxy war fighting.. but are offended when other play against them...,1
Who would have the audacity & self - interest to do this ? ----------------- ISRAEL .,1
"Listening to some of these claims I'm beginning to wonder if statements about the IQ levels of various people are true. Lyndon Johnson may have been on to something when he made his statement about a certain segment. of American society. People who know, know that they know, but don't know are fools. To them it will always be that America gave Iran some free money.",1
Obama's nuclear deal was not really that great. It was not bad either. I think Trump was rash to end it. Trump ended it for better or for worse. Trump has imposed economic sanctions rather than war on Iran.,1
"“Iran’s mission to the U.N., meanwhile, described Fakhrizadeh’s recent work as “development of the first indigenous COVID-19 test kit” and overseeing Tehran’s efforts at making a possible coronavirus vaccine.“",1
ABC is to be commended for determining that Iran's nuclear weapons program has indeed been disbanded. A remarkable achievement.,1
15 January 2007. Ardeshir Hosseinpour. Died.,1
I think the murder was intended to provoke Iran into doing something that would give Trump an excuse to launch an attack in his final days.,1
"Make it your mantra that Israel should not be allowed to exist, and what do you expect?",1
We know the order was given. If they would like trumps florida address I can send it to them if they can't find it.,1
"So first the US assassinated one of Iran's generals (a fitting beginning to this trainwreck of a year) and now this. Maybe neither the US nor Israel had anything to do with it, but the hardliners in both countries would just love to attack Iran.",1
"On a side note, the Trump campaign paid",1
"Seems curious timing, that this ramp up in tensions happens just before the Biden presidency - decreasing the chances Biden will be able to negotiate the return to the JCPOA.",1
Americans have a short memory. Iran is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Americans in Iraq. This act which weakens the Iranian enemy should be praised,1
"“We will respond to the assassination of Martyr Fakhrizadeh in a proper time,"" Rouhani said.",1
"""...bore the hallmarks of a carefully planned, military-style ambush."" WELL, THERE YOU GO. Trump is exonerated, as he has never planned anything, much less carefully in his ""tenure"" in the White House. His Bone Spurs prevent him from any military style ambushing. Sorry, Iran, Trump is too busy dismantling the military here to plan anything else.",1
"iran's nuclear weapons program was never ""disbanded"" abc;",1
Iranians are cowards. IDF F-35 F-15 and F-16 and Saudi F-15 and AWACS are orbiting waiting for cowardly Iran. Iranians are too scared to do anything.,1
It's a good thing Trump brought peace to the Middle East.,1
"I have to wonder if Israel can be consider a terrorist group. Stealing land, killing people it does not look like the chosen ones or maybe they were chosen to create kayos",1
"Only the fat one's uneducated supporters won't accept the this was given the nod by him. He and his corrupt crony Bibi are two of a kind. I'm almost more afraid of the next fifty-some days than I've been over the last four disastrous years. He golfs daily, while almost 300,000 Americans have died. Is it not evident that he could not care less? Is it not evident by his ridiculous lawsuits that he lost this election because of his refusal to address this pandemic? His gargantuan ego will not let him accept that there are millions more who loathe him than who approve of him. There was not one word of comfort to the families of the five soldiers recently killed while deployed. He will continue to slash and burn, possibly involving the US in armed conflict in the middle east, so he can leave as big a mess as possible for the incoming administration. He has done this all of his life; a life of indolence and scandal, slithering his way out of legal problems by lying and cheating. How could this country possibly have expected any more of him than his track record demonstrates? I don't know who said it, but nothing truer is said than ""when someone shows your who they are, believe them""....",1
Has Biden started the apology tour yet?,1
And the police and military are where? Hiding? Or sypathetic to the cleric.,1
attempted to bloc[k] the path of a rally,1
"oddly, no one ever says they've been harassed for their incompetence, and have sued to be given more opportunity to learn.",1
"All these idiots that are doing the harassing, should grow up and start acting like adults . They are acting like school yard bullies--- and I hate bullies---even the one in the White House right now !!",1
I'm willing to bet those oppressors are Rump supporters today.,1
"Winston-Salem is ripe and rampant with ""Proud Boys"" and just plain racist people that hate Black people. It is a town that throws itself back to the days of slavery on a daily basis.",1
"It's not at all suprising nor shocking that the racism, racial bigotry, hatred that exist in the general population abundantly exist in these type and other professions. Brings to mind images of firefighters using powerful fire hoses to attack Civil Rights marches in the '60s, and police using their k-9s to attack them.",1
Poor leadership leads to these issues not being dealt with and the perps being fired. Bad cops get to many chances as well.,1
"Firefighters obviously have too much time on their hands .... much like police officers who create crime when bored. Firefighters and Police work for us, and should be working ALL the time... how about getting them busy with community service, as they should be.",1
I'm sure these bullies believe they are the victims. Symptomatic of the disease of racism that's been fueled by trumpism.,1
America is still a racist country. The post racial idea that many Americans of the majority culture thought happened with the election of President Obama is certainly nonexistent. The Trumpster knew that and played on that during his 2016 campaign and his presidency. Our country will not rid themselves of this reality in the near future. The 73 million Americans who voted for the Trumpster shows that the road to post racial America is a fantasy.,1
"And therein lies the problem with systemic racism and it's tentacles. Trump exposed himself as a bitter racist a long time ago. He has reinforced that racism in the oval office. He received 73 million votes from people who are just as racist as he is. He DEPENDED on it to try to win another term as president. He proved that half the voting public is either racist, or is willing to support a racist to get their right wing objectives met. The ongoing fallacy is that his supporters are toothless, uneducated hicks living in the sticks driving pick up trucks, living on chewing tobacco and beer. Nothing could be farther from the truth. His supporters are also doctors, lawyers, school principals, construction workers, human resource officers, scientists, police officers, prosecutors, gun dealers, judges, banking official, hedge fund managers, students, Governor, members of the House of Representatives, Senators (local, state, and federal), emergency services personnel, etc. These people are as much a part of the fabric as anyone else, extending and poisoning others with 'reasoned' racist arguments. Just try to imagine the damage 73 million hard core Trump supporters, impervious to anything but cult-speak, are doing to 'people not like them' on a daily basis.",1
"I posted my sentiments on another thread, but it bears repeating: Respect the humanity of the person who is different from you, whether it be in color, religious view, sexual orientation, gender identity, or whatever else we come up with to segregate ourselves into “us” and”them.” No, we may not always understand the other person, but acceptance is a first step. And finally, heed your kindergarten teacher’s admonition to LEAVE OTHER PEOPLE ALONE!!",1
Chances are good that you'll find more racism in areas/counties where Trump received the votes.,1
There’s a creature on here downvoting anti-racist comments.,1
And 73 million Nazis & deplorables approve.,1
"Anti- white people!"" white racism causes",1
"I cannot speak to being a Black person but I can speak to being one of very few women majoring in geology many years ago, applying for a job in a male dominated field, and being one of 2 women in a science department. Jokes, interruptions, assignments, comments can really wear on a person. I am glad to see women today speaking out and being heard.",1
People are slow to accept change and some never do. Decades ago a relative of mine who had worked for a utility company since high school was told that her inside job in engineering was being moved to a larger city. Her only choice was to apply for a job as a lineman locally or move. She was the first woman in that position in the region.,1
Why can't these bully firefighters appreciate and accept the expertise that their minority counterparts bring to the table? Why just immediately act like idiotic middle school bullies? Their lives could very well one day be dependent on the very people they've been bullying.,1
"The Winston-Salem group alleged two white captains talked about running over demonstrators protesting the police killing of George Floyd, and that a firefighter made a noose during a rope and knots class in November 2017.",1
"Fire and law enforcement, especially in North Carolina is a hot bed for the ""good ole boy"" system. I live in North Carolina in the mountains and it's very prevelant here. Even across the state line in Rabun County some merchants, if they perceive that you are not known to them, give you the indifferent treatment and don't care if you return. It's sickening. And I'm a white man!",1
You know what I think?,1
"Though there are many good men in the world who treat women as equals under the law and in the workplace or at home, there are also many who hate women or perceive women as having just one purpose because their cultural incapacity has not advanced with the rest of society. Social media has allowed a gathering place for fellow misogynists to meet and strengthen their resolve.",1
Why do some ppl have to be a holes. This is so sad.,1
"This is not surprising. I used to know a Memphis firefighter who told me that his coworkers were mostly very racist, many even attending Klan rallies in Arkansas. . Firefighters do not need a college degree so it should not surprise us that many of the worst people will gravitate towards such jobs (the police are even worse, of course).",1
"Winston-Salem is very close to Greensboro NC. This area may share the same racist attitude. Back in 1979, anti-racist marchers were attacked by kkk & neo-nazi counter-protesters. LE & the mayor knew of the kkk & neo-nazi plans beforehand but did not warn the marchers & did nothing to protect the marchers.",1
"As long as racism and bigotry are protected as free speech this type of stuff will continue to be a problem. At some point talk will lead to action. So it's not going away anytime soon, it more accepted today than anytime in the last 50 years, because decent people failed to get involved.",1
Racism ultimately leads to genocide which means that even in its most subtle form it has to be fought rigorously.,1
Black firefighters in (pick one) allege racism. Of course they do.,1
"As a pasty white redhead who grew up in the the suburbs of Indianapolis, I have to agree that racism was most likely present. I had to cringe every time I heard the ""N"" word. Nasty stuff.",1
I am getting tired of these fake allegations,1

"Worked for a large company once, a white guy and a black guy both were fired for misbehavior. The white guy accepted his misbehavior and after some time found another job. The black guy sued for discrimination. Taking responsibility is the better route instead of trying to ride the wave of today's bs.",1
ABC must have forgotten about all the negative effects Biden has had on LGBTQ+ rights during his time as a politician....,1
"Religious freedom is a pretense for a desire to act out on bigotry in the case of LGBTQ folks, Jews, Catholics, atheists, etc. No religion requires discrimination against any of these groups in operating a business, or any nonprofit organization receiving tax dollars, including churches, to deliver goods or services. Religious freedom isn’t just for extremist Christians - it’s guaranteed also to the people who are most often the targets of the discrimination.",1
"Your religious freedom ends, where my civil rights begin.",1
"Separate church and state. Stop the subsidy. Tax all businesses equally. The SCOTUS overruled NY COVID-19 restrictions for churches because they were more restrictive than for businesses. There you have it, even the churches claim they have the rights of businesses. They need to have the liabilities as well.",1
"It's good someone looks after minority groups, Joe, but please don't make the mistake DEMS have made for the last 2 decades or so, focusing all of your help on minorities and those with alternative sexual orientations while forgetting the average American, which includes a lot of straight, undereducated, underemployed and therefore angry white voters. They are key to winning elections and are Americans, and humans too. Check in with the hill people, the rust belt workers, the Christians, the rural folks, the average Joes. Make them feel included in the new America, show them trump was not the only one who can hear them. Do that or your reign will be short and we will once again be dominated by the next fascist leaning Republican to take over the White House. Not sure America can survive another trump or W.",1
This country will be so much better off once Biden is in office. The last four years have been a horrid embarrassment.,1
YOUR religion shouldn't determine my rights or privileges of citizenship. Just as MY non-religious beliefs shouldn't determine yours. But the religious right has never been ok with that two sided equation. They always want it both ways. Everything they believe should be universal and anyone else's beliefs should be ignored.,1
"Let's stop the worst discrimination in the country, unequal opportunity in education. Education needs to be federally funded and bolstered in communities where the adult population is undereducated.

I'll never understand why we cannot decide we have enough guns on the planet and shut down gun manufacturers. I'm not saying taking away guns. Just to decide we need no more on the planet.

Wow .... it is as though covid is affecting the economy. As though making pretend it is over is not a viable plan. I had a co worker claims that his relative codes claims for medical billing of over 25 area entities from home. A professional so to speak. They told him that there is no actual code for death by covid 19 so everything is suspect. The really weird part is that there is a ICD 10 code for death by covid and another for ascertained death by covid since 1/2020 and instituted by may/2020 in the US agreeing with the initial coding number by the WHO. Sadly within a few min I found it as well as guidances and the coding ICD 10 codes for covid tests and related medical coding for covid treatment among the major medical insurance companies.,1

She said we would have more room and more comfort. We were one of the lucky ones we landed safely. Sometimes you get the Bear and sometimes the Bear gets you, I guess.",1
"The article should have included that the flight crews did not have adequate experience, rest, etc. Certainly Boeing made mistakes in the deployment of the MCAS but there were other contributing factors. The flight crew that flew the aircraft for the Indonesian airline should have passed on their experience. The airline should have ensured that their crews knew what to do. Etc.",1

No. Prison time would help assure they don’t rush jobs and take lives indiscriminately.",1
At least not till stock prices recover anyway....,1
"I still don't understand how and/or why Boeing hasn't been held criminally liable. They murdered over 300 people due to a bad design and the attempt to band-aid the flawed aerodynamics with software. They knew this model was unsafe to fly, yet it flew. Simply pure corporate greed. And now they say it's safe to fly again after rewriting the software as they again attempt to band-aid an unchanged structural design. BULL$H!T !!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"This is what happens when you put bean counters in charge, maximizing profit by offshoring critical work.",1
"This is an example of when a company tries to fix a hardware problem with software. It was quicker to put bigger engines on an existing air frame to compete in the market instead of designing it right the first time in hardware. It happens a lot, but if you mess around with airplanes or medical devices the downside is big enough that maybe we shouldn't rely on software fixes for hardware. I think they still need to get the hardware right. A naturally stable design is far preferred.",1
"Feel sorry for the families. ABC forgot to mention one thing in this story. It was on March 13th 2019 that President Trump grounded all 737 Max jets. He ordered Boeing to ground them. The biased left wing ABC again fails to report the whole story , they won't give this man credit for anything. All they said in the story was that airline after airline began grounding them, that simply is false, it was after Trump ordered them grounded. Poor poor journalism. That's why you can believe anything the mainstream press says and publishes.",1
"Such a SAD STORY. But any time I hear Ralph Nader's name, I CRINGE.",1
At least fix the name of the plane to be more informative as in 737 MAX Danger.,1

Since Biden does not become president elect until the certified results are delivered to, and accepted by, the Senate on Dec. 14 there is plenty of time to let this play out.

Since then it has gone very far-left and actually this is true along the whole west coast. They were moderate states. In WA they had a Republican Governor in the 80's by the name of Dan Evans he was a moderate republican. Today the west coast is far-left but the people are starting to see this does not work and I believe they will begin moving to the middle again which will really upset the far-left.

That left you with the problem that what we can see with our own eyes, is diametrically opposed to electing Joe as president.",0

"""The Office of the President Elect"" props were obviously printed and made before the election, knowing the Democrats were going to steal the election from President Trump and his constituents. The election is such a farce, the mainstream media and Fox News, plotted in unison to destroy President Trump. I also fault the Republicans for allowing the mass mail-in ballot voting that took place and was flawed from the beginning with no verification of validity. When they stop counting votes on election night when President Trump was ahead in all swing-states I knew something was up. The USA cannot allow this to happen now or in the future. This is dangerous and detrimental to our way of life in the USA. I will not except the current voting results as advertised by the Democrats and mainstream media. There are multiple problems with this election. The mainstream media and Fox News do not get to call the election. That is left up to the electors on December 14, 2020 when they cast their votes.

They must have had those signs printed up earlier than Election Day knowing they were going rig the election with voting machines, USB drives, mail in ballots and people sneaking back into the late night hours to ad several made to win ballots on the spot as we all slept.",0
Love the color of red in a blue state.,0
"LOVE IT- ""Democrats HAD expected to make serious gains this year, conservative candidates SHATTERED expectations""",0
Thank God the voters in California are beginning to understand the Democratic Party is NOT the party they knew 15-20 years ago! Any voter who refuses to bend toward socialism had best vote Republican... certainly they should easily see Trump has done more for THEM than the past many Presidents!,0
Thank God the people in CA are waking up. I pray they wake up even more in the year to come. Watching people move away in droves brings a lot of soul searching and realization that the liberal way has put CA in the mess it's in today. MAGA 2024!,0
"California is very blue, could explain why their population growth is stagnant and in fact has shown a slight decrease this year and outside of IL and NY considered the most fiscally poorly managed states. They are also lead by three of the craziest house members, Pelosi, Schiff and Waters.",0
"They tell me I can't believe what my eye balls saw on live TV. In the late-night hours of Nov. 3rd, when the data showed Trump’s votes were soaring to historic figures, a decision was made in several swing states to stop counting the votes. Wonder why?",0
"I voted for Biden because I want my taxes to go up, I want to pay for unemployed illegals healthcare for as long as it takes, I want to get rid of the constitution, guns and police, I want Socialism, riots and have BLM run the country but most of all I voted for Biden because he has proven himself incompetent during 47 years of political life.",0
"Great. Maybe some day we'll get back to reasonable government in California. As it is and has been for too many years we've been under the rule of a legislative cabal that follows the radical Democrat Party's dictatorial Governor. California use to be, under conservative government, a much, much better state.",0
It is about time. Funny how the many races still uncalled all have Republicans leading them. Tell me Dems don't try to cheat in every way. I congratulate the Congressman for taking back the seat. Shows that California is waking up that Dem policies have ruined their beautiful state.,0
"Who knows. Maybe Gen Z are growing up and are beginning to see that the Dems are a party of words and the GOP is a party of deeds. Yes, they have much better orators than Trump, but it's all words. And creating people depending on them to increase voter base isn't going to work. They negate to see that a working person takes great satisfaction from his/her work. Sitting at home getting handouts and getting fat, as we saw from lockdown, creates depression.",0
Hurray. These developments are the first CA have had to cheer in quite some time. Let the red tsunami wash over the US from sea to shining sea.,0
"Well, Truth will triumph over Evil. It may take time to prove it. But Cheaters never prosper, whether in School, Business, or Politics. We learned that in Kindergarten, but some people never learned that. So they couldn't get a ""real"" job and therefore entered Politics where hypocrates reign supreme. They'll get their Ultimate Reward...",0
"When several swing states suddenly decided to stop counting the votes after Trump’s numbers were soaring, I knew we’d been had. By ‘we,’ I mean all supporters of law and order. By ‘had,’ I mean election fraud was now running full speed.",0
"I've no idea if this cases has any chances in court, but I'm glad he's doing this. At a minimum, I'm hoping that there's still SOMEbody left in our government who might see this as something people do when our system of justice otherwise breaks down. If we can't trust the government to do right by it's people, if we can't hold those in charge personally accountable for the kind of actions that the government took against this man, then perhaps taking it to civil courts and a jury of his peers might send that signal. I could easily imagine a string of 10-20 of the people wronged by the DOJ (et al) lining up with these kinds of cases. If they win, I'd like to see that money come from the departments involved (DOJ, CIA, etc.). Maybe THAT might help get the message across.",0
"I hope Page is suing the individual persons involved, separate and apart from their agencies or the Government.  The Government will not indemnify any government employee from their legal liabilities for any acts they commit in the course of their official duties if those acts violate agency/department policy/protocols or are crimes.  Let's see how they like being bankrupted by legal bills or having to sell their houses to pay their bills.  Given the way things are playing out, this may be the only justice that may be obtained.",0
"The only way for any meaningful change is for bad actors like Comey to be directly liable when willfully violating some one's constitutional rights. Currently the only one that will pay for his actions is the government. Yes, us. Many states, mine included have jumped on the BLM bandwagon of prosecuting and doxing cops for their behavior. Let Comey pay as well.",0
"This lawsuit could be vital if Biden gets sworn in. Biden will put an end to the Durham report and lawsuits like this may be the only way of finally exposing these misdeeds. No matter who our next President is, we need to ensure that this type of spying is never perpetrated against another political campaign ever again. No matter the party. Unfortunately, the Demonazi's don't care about any of this because it went against Trump. They won't care until it happens to a candidate that they do care about.",0
"Comey should be personally held responsible for damages. Jail time is also warranted, but that won’t happen either. So for attempting a coup against our government, nothing will happen to them, and American taxpayers will pick up the tab for their illegal and improper actions.",0
"The discovery on this case should be quite embarrassing to the intelligence agencies, and even Adam Schiff.",0
I hope he wins the suit.  all parties being sued need to get a wakeup call. they need to know the regular man is not going to be intimidated.,0
Still zero people being held accountable or being punished. The deep swamp takes care of its own.,0
Outstanding!!!! He will win just like the Covington kid did. There’s enough in just the public domain already for a win. Does anyone know how JUSSIE SMOLLET is doing with his legal case?,0
"Good for him. I hope Comey has to give Paige all his book earnings. A lot of lawsuits come from people who sue innocent people—they want to get rich by makIng false claims. But this lawsuit is desperately needed. Agencies and their employees need to pay a high price to put an end to what is going on in Washington. The FBI lying to the court to spy on an American is a great big deal. And of course that was done to spy on Trump’s campaign. This was not Watergate. This was far worse. Look what they did to Flynn, Trump, and others. FBI is corrupt.",0
"The American people should be allowed to sue elected officials for failing to do their jobs for their constituents and for corruption where necessary, or....We The People simply stop paying our taxes to those who have not earned them. And, I mean STOP PAYING TAXES.",0
This is what Dems will do to American citizens for political gain. I wish Carter Hollywood riches from his lawsuit.,0
"The democrats and liberal media hope everyone forgets all about Nixon and Watergate where he would have been impeached had he not resigned, for spying on the democrats. The democrats used a phony dossier, KNOWING it was phony (and it came from Russia, too, oh, the irony!) to spy on the Trump campaign. I wonder why WaPo didn't go after this story like it did Watergate. Why is that? Probably for the same reason they went after Nixon for those few minutes of erased audio tape, but also sat silent when Hillary deleted over 30,000 emails that were under subpeona. Still don't think our mainstream media and department of ""justice"" are a problem?",0
"First the US taxpayer should not have to pay for this hit job, Comey should. Second, if this goes to trial, can't wait for the depos. Hopefully, several in the DOJ, FBI, etc go to jail for perjury.",0
It's going to be coming out of tax payers' pockets and I hope he gets every penny for which he's seeking. What the deep state and otherwise anti-DJT criminals did from their positions of government authority should be looked upon as one of the darkest stains inflicted upon the Republic and in our country's history.,0
"We are proud of our President issuing EO's to invoke a scorched earth policy after their fake win. Biden will be never able to pull back the economy nor slow millions of corona deaths. He will be hated and despised for the destruction of America. Then, Trump wins 2024 in the biggest landslide ever recorded. Small business may fail as we pulled relief funding and locked it up where only congress could restore the $500 Billion aid. Mitch says it will never happen. 'The working class should accept and applaud the GOP strategy'.",0
"The only thing that bothers me about this is that if Carter Page wins, where does the $75 million come from? If it is from Comey, his corrupt cronies, and the DNC, I am all for it. I do think Page deserves to win, but I don't think it is right for the taxpayer to have to pay.",0
"McCabe: ""We didn't open a case because we liked one candidate or didn't like the other one,"" he said at the time. Well, this is the whopper lie isn't it? The entire program was an attempt to find reasons to listen in on everyone surrounding Trump. That's why the program is called 'crossfire.' They were hoping that Trump would accidentally do or say something that they could use against him. So they made up excuses to open investigations about ""the Russians.""",0
"Since there are no prosecutions for this rabid malfeasance, Page, Stone, and Flynn need to come down on these entities with both feet. I know that we the people eventually pay the bill, but these guys need recompense and the lives of the players need to be uprooted in kind as to what they did to these 3.",0
"Thats nothing, Trump is going to file a 10 billion dollar law suit, they spied on his campaign, transition, and presidency. And all the proof has already been declassified, and testified to.",0
I was wondering when he would be suing though surprised it’s only for 75m. His case has already been proven and admitted. 100% chance of winning. They’ll all just settle.,0
"If CP gets one-third of what he seeks, then five times that mount in punitive damages, and the guilty are prosecuted, then America will be Great Again.",0
The FBI had to lie to the court so the FISA warrant was illegally approved. This action was unthinkably corrupt and subversive. There is no doubt he will win bigly.,0
"Since Barr and Durham have obviously gone to sleep (after spending the last 3 weeks shoving the Comey-McCabe-Brennan-Strzok evidence through a wood chipper 24/7), this looks like the only legal remedy left to provide some justice. Hopefully he gets every dime.",0
"It's about time. Page may need to take his case to the Supreme Court before he's done, but good that he's finally got it in motion. What was done to him and to the incoming Trump administration can never be allowed to happen again.",0
"My recommendation , boycott jury duty , tell the local court clerk we have a two tiered justice system , one for Washington political elite ,Washington career bureaucrats that can get away with anything . Guaranteed they will not seat you on a trial , been there done that and it works . I will continue to refuse until I see changes in the Washington Swamp with the like of Clinton's , Comey , McCabe ,Strozk and others are at least charged and brought to trial .",0
It is about time. One of the common denominators among liberals is the love of money. This suit is the perfect way to rub their elitist little noses into it. Just ask Nick Sandman.,0
I would call 75 million minimal for the law the democratic FBI and CIA broke.,0
Hope Page gets every single dollar he’s suing for.,0
Can’t wait to see Obama and Biden on the witness stand.,0
Biden owes the Hollywood crowd and what better way to please them than to select Garcetti for a position (any position) in his cabinet. Garcetti has been a total failure as Mayor of Los Angeles and to have him at the helm of major cabinet position would benefit Los Angeles (he would be gone!) and for Republicans in 2022 since Garcetti would be a total disaster (anywhere) for the Biden Administration.,0
"Keep your eye on Hunter Biden and what positions he holds, when he got them and what he is making. That’s not connections, that’s abuse of power and we all know what “abuse of power” is cause for. Impeachment.",0
My Hispanic family is very well aware that never in American history have minorities had so many opportunities to lift themselves.  But that's not what many minorities want. They want everything to be handed to them in the form of money. Which will all be gone in a year & then right back to square one making more demands.  Just say no.,0
They should think that through. Garcetti can't do much damage in Transportation because the bureaucrats will run things. The city of LA would get a different mayor. Sounds like a win for LA and BLM hasn't caught on yet.,0
"Garcetti‘s lockdowns are designed to bankrupt small businesses and let people meet their fate that way. He’ll fit right in with the wealth and corruption of Washington — a body of government that doesn’t care if its own people don’t have jobs and starve to death. Even a stimulus is too much for them to pass, as they drive to their cozy homes in their luxury automobiles. This country needs a revolution. Bad.",0
So a small percentage of the population wants to control what the rest of us want?,0
So now we have a guy who hasn't done much of anything in 47 years in Washington as President elect. What does he do but take mayors from loser cities to be his advisors in the cabinet. Makes perfect sense. It is going to be a long two years until 2022. I hope our country can survive.,0
"Everything BLM does is aimed at more reparations. Then more. And more & more.  I say more because US Taxpayers have already paid over a trillion in reparations over the past 80-years in the form of welfare, housing, job training, & college grants.",0
BLM tells the Squad how it's gonna be and the Squad tells Joe how it's gonna be. Lovely. I hope we are still a free country after 4 years of BLM rule.,0
"what's the Democratic establishment gonna do when blm starts ""peacefully"" protesting against everything they do? Today it's cabinet appointments. what will it be next week? I'm looking forward to the show",0
How can a domestic terror organization have so much influence? It should be considered an enemy of the state and prosecuted.,0
"I just can't wait for the next government to be installed. Hate, vitriol and colorful language will be the soup du jour for the next four year. Whatever is left of the economy after the tax hikes, free everything and Green spending will be table scraps for the foul mouthed, entitlement addicted Democratic Party supporters.",0
"I am very much looking forward to Biden having to deal with this group. They are unyielding, unreasonable folks. BLM has zero interest in any middle ground or compromise. BLM is 100% about demanding compliance. Have fun, Joe. You guys have emboldened them now they are all yours...",0
Biden's voters are going to revolt one way or another since their goal is to force socialism on us so they can have welfare and defund cops. Then Biden will have to contend with us if his felons escalate their violence and if he tries to legally enable them.,0
"Is it not a smidge coincidental the group ""demanding"" to get rid of police, as well free all inmates, and completely eliminate prisons, by far dominate all statistics that measure crime and incarceration? Very fishy.",0
"So BLM isn't going to stop even though Joe Biden, their candidate has won? Interesting how the media is going to ""spin"" this.",0
They want to cut the police budget by 90%. Now what would the result of that be?,0
"Dems and BLM are so busy out ""fighting racism"" that they ignore the fact that the cultural impact of these slaughter houses they call cities is affirming racial stereotypes and adding to the count of racist tendencies to folk observing the carnage. If you want to fight racism, fight to prove these stereotypes wrong!",0
"Government work.....the only industry where you can be rewarded for incompetence, non-productivity, and a lack of leadership by being considered for a higher appointed position inspite of having done nothing to earn this consideration in the first place.",0

"Biden has not learned who he is working for yet, he will soon enough remember BLM said right after he was declared ""president elect"" that it was pay back time.",0
"We won’t allow/we demand/We’re telling @joebiden/We also demand that....  In the olden days we used to complain about politicians being owned by lobbyists. HAH, if only we had known how lucky we were. Now that our politicians are owned by marxists and violent anti american looters and shooters.",0
Did Joe really think the rioting would stop if he won the election. Payments will be due on a regular basis.,0
"Good luck Dems with the results of your identity politics. “You can please some of the people all of the time. You can please all of the people some of the time. But you cannot please all of the people all of the time”. What’s frightening is that the people in your party demand that you please them or they will burn, loot, attack, and riot. Thanks so much for the coming disaster.",0
"It's cute that burn, loot, mayhem think they can influence QuidproJoe now that the election is over. Then again they aren't the sharpest crayons in the box.",0
Guess what.....it does not matter what you say.  Where is the resistance to a proven failed Kamala Harris and a proven political career in Biden.....Oh wait....you can tell Biden what to do.....HMMMMMMM!  You would never see this done to a real President Trump....voters simply did not get it....nuff said!,0
obama gave them EBT and free phones. Trump gave them the lowest unemployment rate in history. They didn't want the jobs. They voted for EBT and free stuff.,0
"BLM is a domestic terrorist group who has committed crimes against the police, law abiding citizens, looted. Vandalized and destroyed public and private property. They have no room to talk or be heard by anybody. The rat Dems are never going to do anything for BLM, they were used as a tool to manipulate a presidential election. The only President in recent history to help minorities was Trump. All you have to do is look at his policies. Dems have manipulated our citizens to push their socialist agenda. This agenda will destroy our country as we know it, and they must be stopped!",0
Did Biden run this by by AOC and the squad? He could get in big trouble. Nancy needs to sit down with Biden and do some 'splainin! Biden needs a playbook in LARGE PRINT. Soros will write it for him.,0
"You know, if BLM was an HONEST BROKER...They would have raised Cain over Kamala Harris as the VP Pick.  She used her Political Power to ABUSIVELY PROSECUTE Blacks while she was DA in San Fransisco...",0
BLM has to be really disappointed with all the money they funneled to politicians. They think that they are not getting all that they paid for.,0
Trump promised the majority of black communities everything. And his record of keeping promises is well documented. Yet they continue to vote Democrat.,0
During the summer the mayor rejected the group’s proposal to cut the police department's $1.8 billion operating budget by 90%.  If they did that crime would increase by 1000%.,0

"It's 1930s Germany all over again  BLM, ANTIFA and Refuse Fascism are now the Democrat party's very own Sturmabteilung -- the brown shirts of 1930s Germany -- meting out violence and demanding people they encounter raise their fists in a salute of solidarity or suffer the consequences, while leftist platforms like CNN, Twitter and Facebook have assumed the role of propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, silencing any speech deemed contrary to their agenda",0
Sorry BLM the Democrats used you for VOTES only. Biden could careless about you and your families.,0
"Mr Giuliani told the panel of Republicans that there were problems with their mail-in ballots - a key component of the Trump administration’s legal argument.  ""The mail-in ballots that were received were not inspected at all by any Republicans. They were hidden from Republicans,"" he said.  He said he ""couldn't be entirely sure,"" though.  Any surprise that kind of presentation in a court of law gets tossed out?",0
"States where the election was close and Trump won, no theories of fraud. States where the election was close and Trump lost, lots of theories of fraud.  Amazing how a national conspiracy was arranged and those involved knew to within sometimes less than a percent, which one's to target. And the fraud was only for Trump, even on the same ballot where a Rep congress person won.  This is better organized than the fake moon landings.",0
Trump in his business dealings has had thousands of lawsuits either filed by him or against him. I am wondering what Trump's success rate is for his own lawsuits when he isn't able to outspend the other party? I bet he loses more than he wins.,0
Anyone care to guess what Trump's 4 year average GDP growth will be?  How about this year's budget deficit. Here's a hint: it would have been 1.7 trillion WITHOUT Covid.,0
"Trump supporters, serious question... If Trump didn’t keep screaming for 8 months that mail in ballots wouldn’t get there in time OR that they would be mishandled, would you have voted mail-in? The problem is that he told ALL of his supporters to NOT vote by mail. Then...he acts surprised that when they start the mail in count that 90% of them come in for Biden. That’s not fraud. That is poor messaging on his behalf.",0
Now trump's largest donors are suing him to get their money back.  Apparently he assured them that he had at least SOME evidence of cheating. Turned out there was NONE.,0

Legal efforts to date have been unsuccessful in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada and Pennsylvania.""  This last paragraph is, by far, the most pertinent.",0
"Trump did this to himself. We ALL had the opportunity to request mail in ballots. Trump told his people NOT to use this method. He banked on them all coming in late (why he felt this way is a later discussion). So, instead of taking advantage of it, he turned people away.",0
"Trump lost PA appeal  A federal appeals court in Pennsylvania has delivered a strongly worded repudiation of Trump’s latest attempt to overturn his presidential election defeat, dismissing his challenge to the state’s results as without merit, and backing a district judge who likened Trump’s evidence-free and error-strewn lawsuit to “Frankenstein’s monster”.  On 11/27, a three-member panel confirmed unanimously a lower court’s decision last week to rebuff the arguments made by Trump’s legal team, led by Giuliani, that voting in Pennsylvania was marred by widespread fraud.",0
"Trump should have just claimed rigged and stolen but not went to court. That would have cast doubt, but going to court has proven this election was fair and square the more he loses. Trying to get PA legislature to stage a coup is also very telling. Dec 14th can't come fast enough.",0
"As an independent, I felt compelled to vote for Biden out of an inability to vote for Trump. But, I looked forward to the next Republican candidate that would turn the party around. Now that I see only a portion of the party strong enough to speak out against these baseless, meritless attacks on our democracy, I doubt they will be able to shake this level of shame by the next election.",0
"Charges of unfairness are serious. But calling an election unfair does not make it so. Charges require specific allegations and then proof. We have neither here,” Trump appointee Judge Stephanos Bibas wrote in an opinion filed Friday for the three-judge panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The judges on the panel were all appointed by GOP presidents.  “Voters, not lawyers, choose the President. Ballots, not briefs, decide elections,” the court said. “This campaign cannot win this lawsuit",0

There was no more risk of in person voting than going to the grocery store. 99% recovery rate.. fact. But Democrats and their puppet MSM unnecessarily panicked people. Its much easier to commit voter fraud with mail in ballots so let's panic people. So sad....Democrats knew they were going to lose so they had to steal the election with massive fraud. Shows just how corrupt they are.,0
"Real patriots only want the LEGAL votes counted in Ohio, not the ILLEGAL votes that many are talking very strongly about.",0
"So Ohio mail-in vote was not fraud? How is this possible? Trump said ALL vote by mail was fraud and favored Biden, but in Ohio was fair and favored Trump? Oh my God!!!!",0
Republicans legally stopped voting on Election Day. Democrats kept illegally voting after Election Day until they won.,0
Ohio election was part of a massive fraud that tried to rob Biden of the presidency. Of course I have no proof of that but apparently you don't need proof.,0
We should get some investigation happening here... only count legal votes.,0
when they let the Dems use mail in ballots the fix was in..,0
"If you think this ""election"" was on the up and up think again.",0
"Trump cheer leading by Fox .. imagine that Some weekend math -- President Trump has visited a golf course on 21.8% of the 1,408 days of his presidency, or roughly 1 in 5 days. He has visited a Trump property on 29.7% of the days of his presidency, or roughly 1 in 3 days.",0
"Just in:  Ohio certifies, Trump still loses the presidency!",0
I won't accept these results unless Trump can PROVE they are legit. Isn't that how it works now?,0
yeah. They didn't cheat there. Fair and Honest. Something Democrats don't know anything about.,0
"Something to think about. Trump won Ohio, and Florida, no President has ever won without those 2, we took 11 House seats 4 in Cali., didn't lose a senate seat, and turned several State legislatures. We go to bed election night with Trump up in all the battleground by hundreds of thousands, then lo and behold they stop the counting, throw out the observers and next thing you know Joementia has 80 million votes, I dont think so! Him and Kamala coundn't get 5% in the primaries together. This election is being stolen.",0
Kasich knows the guy was unjustly targeted for their false collusion theory . They wasted 4 years on nothing,0
Kasich could have really provoked the CNN panel by alluding to charges of voter fraud and how it could have affected the election.,0
"Kasich's ideas are no more. He will not move forward politically as a conservative democrat or traditional republican. Neither of these types will win elections from here forward. Biden will be the last of his type due to his generation reaching beyond old age in power. By the end of his first term the new generation ""socialists"" types will be a majority in the democratic party. A majority will not vote for common conservative. The new type must be more proworker rather than pro business.",0
"Articles about ""swamp"" members that play both sides to stay in the media lime-light don't interest me. At this point, I am only paying attention to my vanishing ""Civil Liberties"".",0
"Not sure he has a base in either party these days. Some on the left still think Flynn is guilty of something in the face of evidence that clearly proves his innocence. Don't really care if they bash Kasich or not-----but in doing so, they've proven they aren't ready to move-on! In 2016 the ""resistance,"" and call for impeachment began the day after the election---Comments like the ones criticizing Kasich are not going to put Trump supporters in the mood to just ""move on!"" I suspect they will be opposed every single day of the Biden administration.",0
"Kasich is learning what the Left does after it no longer needs its anti-Trump collaborators. He would have to continually undermine everything conservatives hold sacred to dodge this. Note that the ""Lincoln Project"" (purportedly Republicans) is still held in high regard by the liberal media (though not really.)",0
A nothing story. No one cares what Kasich thinks and no one watches CNN...it really is that simple,0
Outrage over a person being railroaded by corrupt FBI but not a wimper about the dual justice system in DC.,0
"The the guy betrayed his own party and then falls out with the devils he conspired with. Sounds poetically just. You reap what you sow. Actions have consequences. Nobody likes a traitor, not even the enemy.",0
"Ever seen the list of people pardoned by Clinton , Bush and Obama? He's right ,move on",0
He’s a Democrat now. He’s their mess. Republicans have more important things to do.,0
"You really thought you were their friend, you could straddle the fence, because they will listen to logic. You forgot - dems eat their own. Congrats you accomplished having both the dems & republicans to now despise you!!!",0
"On January 22, 2017, Flynn was sworn in as the National Security Advisor, and on February 13, 2017, he resigned. He was part of the Trump administration for only 27 days! What exactly did he have to do with Trump's alleged ""...four year crime spree""? These liberals spew nothing but intolerance, anger, vitriol, and hate - they are way more dangerous to the fabric of our democracy than Trump's bad behavior!",0
Kasich is the poster child for political expediency gone wrong. He never knows what he believes until he first takes a poll. He has now managed to become a pariah to both parties. Well done.,0
been a while since i agree with kasich but agree time to move on. and as far as hollywood elites like alec baldwin they all have little influence over me with respect to living and politics except for the sole purpose of entertaining me that is it.,0
"John Kasich is an island in the Arctic Ocean that NO ONE wants to visit. Going full on RINO destroyed your position in the Conservative Party and of course, now the Democrats want nothing to do with you. Hang it up John...you’re toast.",0
"You picked your friends, Kasich. Enjoy.",0
"On January 19, 2017, which was Obama’s last full day in office, BO issued more commutations than the past 13 presidents combined and that included commuting Chelsea Manning’s 35-year prison sentence!!... Furthermore, Hussein pardoned Marine General James Cartwright who had pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. about leaking classified information to Newsweek and the NY Times and would have been sentenced to a lengthy jail term!!.. In total BO pardoned 1,927 individuals convicted of federal crimes!!",0
"Kasich is what he is...how can anyone like him? lay down with dogs, John and you get up with fleas. There doesn't seem to be a place for you..time to try living off the grid..?",0
"Kasich, this is what you get for flirting with the enemy. Now that Dems have gotten all they can out of you, we don't want you back. Go ahead and just retire. You are a man without a party.",0
"Yeah, i am missing something when they still say “fellow Republicans"" when you give a keynote speech for your rival’s national convention.",0
Flynn actually did nothing wrong. He didn't lie to the FBI he admitted to lying under duress.,0
"Yep, all the banjo playing crazies upset that an innocent man was pardoned. It was that corrupt judge that refused to drop the charges against Flynn, only for political reasons, forcing Trump to pardon the General.",0
"It seems these left wing dilettante journalists know nothing about the malfeasance of Comey and the FBI in the Flynn case. When the Flynn case is mentioned in main stream media, it's never brought up. Welcome to the filtered press of the future. Pravda anyone?",0
"Absolutely. Hilli, Comey, clapper and that whole crowd should have been up on charges.",0
"Kasich deserves to be on CNN with all the rest of the losers. Remember, he once was for all the conservative principles before he is now against them. Purely for the money. He has lost all credibility with people that matter. He is now a footnote in relevancy. Good riddance. To all ten of the CNN viewers, you deserve him.",0
Trump will be stuck in these liberals heads for the remainder of their lives. They're welcome.,0
Donald trump has not been defeated. Hes been cheated out of reelection by the largest election fraud operation in history. No John we will not move on either.,0
"If, perception is ""everything"", then Gen. Mattis, being a retired general, plus ex-administration official really has no business dealing with, nor touting the relationship with a ""known enemy"", and economic adversary of the United States. Not good form General.",0
"This type of thing is exactly why there was such a strong push to get Trump out. It wasn't BLM, it wasn't student debt,it wasn't Medicare for all. He was trying to stop government officials from selling us down the road and frankly they didn't like it.",0
"All of our pandemic issues are due to China. They spread the virus, and then to further compound our problems, 85% of our medical products come from China. (As well as almost everything else we buy). After the huge demand for PPE equipment, China enacted a China first priority for those items. America is too dependent on China for manufactured products. We have bolstered their economy to the detriment of our own. America SHOULD put America first. To do otherwise, undermines the country.",0
"I generally have a reasonable amount of respect for members of the military, but Mattis fits in the group of military political hacks that are the corruptive ruin of the whole military hierarchy. Too bad Trump didn't have good advice on who and what Mattis is as it would have saved him lot of headaches.",0
"expect more of this in a Biden Adm. Why? Retreads, dividing our Intel community in a way that only the INSIDE knows, but we on the outside ""don't"" know. The weaker the top, the less control of a situation or agency, just a lot of lack of responsibility, excuse laden by pointing finger at unrelated sources, just like Comey did in the FBI.",0
"The Chinese can buy anyone. Generals, Politicians, Actors, the Press, Big Tech. etc. In 10-20 years people will understand Trump was the last line of defense.",0
"Jim Mattis has long been known to, us retired military, as a long term member of the entrenched swamp. He is one of President Trumps true mistakes as an appointee.",0
"Remember when Obama attended the G20 summit in China and Chinese officials were pushing Susan Rice and other WH officials around? That was during the Obama administration, not the Trump administration.",0
Add Mattis to the very long list of people (including Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton) who just cannot admit when Trump was right and they were wrong or who were not able to accomplish what Trump did accomplish.,0
So now we have a General on China's payroll. He never resigned his commission and we have laws against what he is doing. His Simper Fi is sagging and lacking! Article 88 of the UCMJ states that commissioned military officers who use “contemptuous words” against the president shall be punished by court-martial. It applies to retired regular commissioned officers and those on active duty.,0
"I don't know about the rest of you, but I definitely want my president to put the US first and foremost. All other comers are also-rans. He/she was voted in to serve the US. The idea that America First is a problem is ridiculous. That's how it should be. Not that other countries will be disregarded. But first and foremost the POTUS is elected to serve the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. So please tell me what is the issue?",0
"I have lost all respect for Mattis, which deeply hurts me. While he was a Marine he was almost idolized by his men. Now, he is nothing more than a political hack. How the mighty fall.",0
"As An old Combat Marine, I am very thankful that The Marine General who led me in battle was head and shoulders above General Mattis. ! General Mattis is a big disappointment to me.  Semper Fi to my fellow Marines and to our Corps !",0
"I was a big fan of Mattis. Even after he resigned. After all, if you disagree with your presidents policies, you should resign. But when he started joining the chorus of snakes like Brennan and Comey, chiefly by undermining a duly elected president in public newspaper articles, and takes a consulting fee for it. I lost all respect for him. Which is sad after the life of service he led. But, it’s obvious he is just another Washington establishment stooge.",0
"It pains me as a retired Marine to hear how Mattis supports Biden and thinks we should cozy up to China, like the Biden family has done for years. And then we read Mattis's golden parachute includes an advisory role with the Cohen Group who has offices in China. Officially part of the beltway establishment now.",0
"During my 30 mile drive drive to work, I recognize at least 30 homeless guys, many of them veterans fallen on hard times, living under overpasses and river beds. Why would anyone question the ""AMERICA FIRST"" concept? Mind boggling.",0
"Retired U S Navy was a great admirer of General Jim Mattis , but he has gone off the deep end in past several years. China is the biggest threat to United States now he is involved with the Cohen group with offices in China ! They believe china has an enormous opportunities trading with the United States ! I now understand why President Trump fired you !",0
"Mattis is so typical of most military officers, they climb that ladder on the backs of the people under them, they play all the political angles to get their stars, because they know with those stars they will be knee deep in the pay to play scam as soon as they retire, but ones like Mattis are the worst of the worst, Holds the post of Sec. Defence and then sells out to China the second he's no longer part of the government. Goes to show where his loyalties lie.",0
"Jim Mattis works with the Cohen Group, an international business advisory firm active in China. Is there anybody in America that China hasn’t bought yet!!! Unbelievable...",0
"At some point we're going to realize (hopefully) that ""globalism"" does not imply some wonderful state of diversity in which all peoples of the earth hold hands and sing Kumbaya, but it means communist Chinese hegemony. The facts that elites such as Mattis and the Bidens' get incredibly rich in dealing with China should not drive our foreign policy, but with middle-class Joe in the White House it almost certainly will.",0
So much for Mattis adhering to the once a marine always a marine. Now he’s closer to than ever to abandoning his oaths and country for profit. He also seemed to have left his honor and integrity in the Uber.,0
"Why would an American President serve other countries first? Isn't an American President voted by the American people to lead a government ""by the people and for the people""? So now tell me what is wrong with ""America first"" as a policy?",0
"So an American first policy would cost the International China company millions, got it. So basically Mathis sold out America.",0
"I do not care what service they were in or what political party they belong to, nor how meritorious their service may have been. Any active or retired flag officer who does not believe in ""America First"" is a traitor and should be stripped of all honors.",0
"Very ""Cheap Move"" on Mattis's part ... Lost all Respect for that Old Politician!",0
"You don't get to be heard by the Supreme Court just because you want to.  They have to agree to take up the case based on an analysis of the evidence offered in the lower courts. But because no evidence was presented in the lower courts, SCOTUS has nothing to review. There were no decisions made, no rulings or injunctions to overturn. It's nothing like Bush v. Gore.  This isn't actually a strategy to get a SCOTUS ruling on the election. It's just an expensive PR campaign.",0
"I wish the Republicans would do some research before they retweet incorrect ballot numbers. There were not 1.9 million ballots requested and 2.5 million returned. There were actually 3.1 million ballots requested, over 1.9 million of those were sent to democrats while another 300k were registered independent. Then another 700k or so went to republican voters. Needless to say, that’s quite a difference from their allegations.",0
"Whose money is Trump spending on these farces? Three million dollars were spent on the Wisconsin recount, which showed that Biden actually got 132 MORE votes. So Donald spent $27,000 for each of those increased Biden votes. Great ROI.  And this is a businessman?",0
"“LIVE UPDATES: Trump campaign eyes Supreme Court after appeals panel tosses Pa. fraud case”  Um, the opinion handed down by the 3rd Circuit says specifically that there were no claims of fraud or illegal voting in the rejected appeal.",0
"It isn't an ""activist"" court - it is three conservative judges, and the one appointed by Trump wrote a scathing opinion that the case has no merit, and elections are decided by voters, not in court. SCOTUS may not even take the case, but I hope they do and shove it down Trump's throat so we all know it had no merit. You can't bring in new evidence and testimony at the SC.",0
"They haven't just lost in court, they have been laughed out of the building. If the Supreme Court EVER took this case it would weaken the institution (that's already become political) even further. I really don't see this happening.",0
"If Trump SCOTUS appointees even consider this brazen attempt to overturn this election, we need to consider judicial investigations and impeachment. And Trump needs to be indicted for trying to fix the outcome of this election.",0
You guys remember that time Trump paid 3 million dollars for a recount in WI only to have Biden gain an extra 138 votes?  That's where your donations are going to.,0
"Trumpy is just gambling, thinking that because he appointed judges to the supreme court they will stand by his side as payment back favor.",0
So these court cases apparently show the last of Trump's campaign lies for the empty words they were. He said there would be so much winning that we'd get sick of it. The people have been winning these court cases he's brought at every turn but I ain't sick of winning them yet.,0
I wanted to put a big shout out to Trump for spending the $3million to recount the votes in Wisconsin and adding to Biden's victory margin. Thank you Mr. President!,0
The Supreme Court should not even hear the meritless case of DJT. Not only would it be meddling in our elections but it would be very dangerous to our democracy.,0
Trump is the only president to lose the popular vote twice. Losing very strongly. Losing like no one has ever lost before. Many people are saying it.,0
Republicans need to stop Trump now. To even have SCOTUS take up this ridiculous case gives the Democrats major ammunition to pack the court. Even to listen to the case would show extreme partisanship. Trump and the GOP is playing with fire.,0
The results of the Wisconsin recount ( which cost the RNC $3 M ) gave Joe Biden even more votes ! The Democrats actually like recounts and court challenges. It gives us a chance to defeat you again and again.,0
35+ lawsuits laughed out of court. Even appeals courts are laughing at Trump. Is he tired of losing yet?,0
"The opinion of the Appeals Court was written by a judge that Trump had appointed. He wrote: ""Charges of unfairness are serious. But calling an election unfair does not make it so. Charges require specific allegations and then proof. We have neither here. Voters, not lawyers, choose the president. Ballots, not briefs, decide elections.""",0
"Trump would be extremely lucky if the SCOTUS can summon the necessary 4 votes to even hear the Pennsylvania case, let alone prevail. They will decline.",0
"After Trump lost yet another baseless case, many handed down by Trump appointed lifetime Federal judges, he was overheard remarking, ""That's the last time I'll appoint them to lifetime Federal judgeships.""",0
If Rudy has this evidence of 47 missing USB cards why was it not presented in court? Beats me.,0
"“Free, fair elections are the lifeblood of our democracy. Charges of unfairness are serious. But calling an election unfair does not make it so. Charges require specific allegations and then proof. We have neither here.  ""Voters, not lawyers, choose the president. Ballots, not briefs, decide elections. [The] campaign’s claims have no merit.”  Judge Stephanos Bibas",0
"How many think the supreme court will ignore the fact that Biden got about 70 more elector votes and 8 million more popular votes than Trump, and declare Trump the winner? Show Of Hands.",0
"Trump is still fighting to date despite of all court decisions are against him, and he needs to turn the result at least in three states with large differences in the votes. Imagine what he will do if he need only one state to win !!",0
"Trump is going to learn that he can't bully the Supreme Court the way he's been able to bully the spineless Republican ""leadership.""",0
Not reported on Fox today - Wisconsin recount finishes with Biden picking up 138 votes. Maybe we need to count again. Or file a lawsuit without merit.,0
I hear Trump is appealing to Putin to rule that Trump won the election by 4 trillion popular votes and 8000 in the EC.,0
Notice how the scathing remarks on the merits of the PA case are made by none other than a trump appointed judge!! Priceless!!!,0
Tell Omar we need more towels in Room 812. Thanks.,0
Brennan also signed a warrant to do surveillance on me about 14 years ago.,0

"Is there a statute to prevent individuals from claiming falsely to represent the United States government in the United States? If there is, it would be simple to charge Omar.",0
AOC and the squad genuinely believe they can make something true simply by saying that it is.,0
A great many Americans believe everything Omar says & does is against America's best interests because she very badly seems to want to see democracy fall.,0
Omar trying to interpret a statute is like Adam Schiff telling the truth: they just can't do it.,0
"Brennan and Omar are cut from the same cloth; self-serving political hacks making a small fortune off the backs of working Americans. And the truly amazing thing is that neither one shows an ounce of self awareness, humility or shame at their blatant self aggrandizement, but then that's pretty typical of our current ruling elites.",0
Omar and the squad cost Democrats 12 house seats when they were projected to win them.  The squad I influence days are numbered,0
"Anyone here from her district? Can you tell us, has your life improved in any meaningful way since you elected her? If you honestly cannot say yes then it's seriously time to re-evaluate your choice making...",0
"anytime any member of the squad is mentioned, my volume dial goes to zero.",0
"After what they did to Michael Flynn, Johnny Brennan should be arrested. Let him spend the next 2 years and his family fortune defending himself to stay out of jail.",0
"Omar needs to go, seriously. We need to get her out of the congress, her ideas are very destructive to the American ways of thinking.",0
Why is this thing from Somalia here? Much less a member of Congress. Only democrats. Thanks Minnesota. Why don’t you guys consider moving to Somalia since you obviously don’t want to be part of the US.,0
"I don't know what Omar's area of expertise might be but I don't think she's an expert on the Logan Act or anything other than creating a fraudulent background ... and getting away with it. That, she seems very good at.",0
Papadopoulos should be pardoned and Mueller's team should be prosecuted.,0
"The Dems are corrupt. The Democrats still run Washington DC. Washington DC is 76% registered Democrats. 6% registered Republican. Those numbers would include all the bureaucrats working in DC for 20 and 30 years. Including investigators, prosecutors and jury members. The Democrats run all of Washington DC and have wasted four entire years only trying to impeach Trump.",0
Durham? Who's that? What does he have to show for 2 year's work?,0
Trump should pardon anyone convicted of anything related to the Russian persecution.,0
"A felony charge for lying to agents who had lied to him? Meanwhile, Biden lied about his involvement in the coup to undermine Flynn. And his crack pipe child porn son hasn't even been indicted.",0
"Robert Mueller needs to be in prison for twenty years. He lied to Congress and the Citizens of the United States. He Clearly a Traitor.Those in the FBI, DOJ, and CIA who played a part in the Russian Investigation Hoax should pe Publicly Executed, for Attempting to Overthrow our Duly Elected President. And let's hear more about Hunter and the Biden Family Corruption. Treat Biden EXACTLY as you did Trump!",0
"Do it Mr. President. Our politics have infected the federal judiciary (Ninth Circus, goofball unethical judge Sullivan, John Roberts).",0

"the squad members are very quick learners on how to game the system. so much money flowing in and as it is spent on very flexible 'campaign expenses,' no taxes and a beautiful lifestyle.",0
Can congressional house members be fired for spending too much time on social media and gaming and not enough time actually working?,0
Someone must have told them they could write the cost off on their Federal and State Taxes. I'll bet the T-Shirts are made in China or some other Foreign Country?,0
"Two members of the odd ""squad"" utilizing Capitalism, which will surely never work when we become a socialist nation, to benefit their pocketbooks.",0
"The 'squad' seems to forget that their constituents don't want discounts, they want free! If someone else isn't paying for it, they don't want it.",0
"AOC's most popular item is a shirt with two horseshoes, and in between it says ""clip clop... clip clop...""",0

"Since they got away with their campaign financing violations, how much of the sale proceeds are going into their PERSONAL BANK ACCOUNTS ???",0

"They are not public servants, they're something else, not sure what the right word here is but it has nothing to do with supporting the people or furthering the interest of this Nation. So sad that they hold office.",0
Squad members are giving 25% of their earnings to charity. AOC and tribe also said they will not be accepting their paychecks in 2021. According to the squad they were so impressed that President Trump did not accept his paycheck they will do the same.,0
Absolutely great! Now let’s unite against the RINO’S in GA by boycotting the rigged January senate election. Boycott Georgia RINO’S.,0
Way to go Dr Miller-Meeks and congratulations. Getting more republican representation in the house is badly needed and will make a huge difference over the next 2 years.,0
